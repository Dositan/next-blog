# What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React Framework. Simply React with batteries included. With Next, you can do SSR, SSG and many more.

On the previous post I talked about how easy React was to master, but this time, with Next.js, I couldn't say the same.

# What's the problem?
Most of all, in my opinion, it's following the guide and reading docs instead of watching straightforward YouTube tutorials. I know that the first option is considered the best practice, but I'm really into video-based tutorials.

I'll try to update the blog quite often, by capturing my progress discovering this framework.

Also planning to learn TypeScript usage in projects.

So here are my goals till the next week:
- Get familiar with Next.js
- Learn about more hooks
- Build simple projects
- Use TypeScript
